"""Render MADR files from beads `decision` beads.

The bead is the record; the file is a projection of it. Nothing here is a source
of truth, so this never edits a bead and never syncs: it reads the local Dolt
store through `bd export` and writes markdown.

`bd export` rather than `bd list --type decision --json`, which omits `design`,
`notes`, `dependencies`, and `spec_id` -- the fields an ADR is made of. Rather
than `bd show` per bead too: show carries everything but costs ~0.45s each,
where one export costs ~0.45s total and is byte-identical across runs.

Only CLOSED decisions render. A `deferred` bead is a proposed decision nobody
has settled, and an `open` one is being drafted right now; writing either to
docs/adr/ would publish a choice that has not been made.

Exit codes: 0 on success or any environment gap (no `bd`, no database, no
decisions), 1 only when rendering itself fails. A missing tool must not block a
commit -- see the hook-contract fail-open rule.
